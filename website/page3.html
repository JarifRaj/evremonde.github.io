    <p id="aboutText">I am utterly baffled. My capricious nephew has renounced his position as the Marquis!<br><br> As such, he will get his name removed from this site at my earliest convenience. Though, the situation would place myself in a predicament,<br><br> as now I have no heir. I don’t care a considerable amount since following my passing, I would not be present to care.<br><br> I’m rather poetic, aren’t I? I studied poetry in Brussels for a summer or two. Every Belgian knows me now.<br><br> Seriously, approach a Belgian, and ask them if they’re familiar with my work. Everyone will answer affirmatively, I tell you. <br><br> Regardless, my nephew seems to be strangely sympathetic with the dogs we profit off of. His sympathy befuddles me, <br><br> since, if the dogs weren’t so lazy, then they would have a deal of success in their lives. Unfortunately, they don’t, <br><br> so I am forced to make them work harder by raising my prices so they can hopefully acquire <br><br> a decent attitude towards work and finally accomplish something. I know, it is wishful thinking. <br><br> I, of course, acquired my immense fortune via nothing but dedication and hard work. <br><br> Along the way, I invented electricity, water, and candles. I am also an acclaimed inventor. <br><br> I am quite the genius, you see. My nephew doesn’t understand my vision with the peasantry, <br><br> he told me, what was it, “we did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us <br><br> and our pleasure, whatever it was.” (108). He thinks I’m doing this for my own pleasure! No, I am doing this for <br><br> the betterment of the dogs! My pleasure is worth more than theirs anyway. <br><br> Those who will not improve, they may remain obedient to the whip. <br><br> Those who do, they may live a better life, and maybe even become like me one day, although not as great as me. <br><br> I am doing a public service. I need to take my mind off of my former heir…. <br><br> I also visited that gluttonous Monseigneur! O, what a beast he was! He looked like a giant toad sitting upright. <br><br> Although I must thank him for the spectacle. Those rooms were “adorned with every device of decoration <br><br> that the taste and skill of the time could achieve.” (92).  It was astonishing to see. Someone so humble as myself couldn’t <br><br> have possibly stood there for more than a small amount of time, for I am not one to stoop as low as them in haughtiness. <br><br> I left, racing through the city streets. I was in fear for my life, then, you know. <br><br> It was dark and dangerous, indeed, I saw someone run over a child! Who could do such a thing? <br> Anyway, I went along, in my carriage, to my chateau and my nephew gave me that speech. <br> O, what a long night! I am tired. I believe that “I am cool now… and may go to bed”. (111).
