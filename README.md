Please use a laptop or a desktop computer to run this website. I am unsure of compatibility on mobile devices.
If it still scales incorrectly and elements of the website are displayed on top of each other, or any other strange artifacting happens, I apologize. I currently have no way of testing it on multiple screen sizes. The content will almost always be readable, though, in my experience. If not, then I can show you what the website is intended to look like. Again, it should probably (like 99% chance) work.
